# CodeEcho

A minimalistic code editor built using Java swing, flatlaf and RSyntaxTextArea. This Code editor also supports basic voice commands like delete file , rename file , open terminal etc.
This project is meant for learning and experimental purposes, by no means this is a production-ready code editor, but rather a fun attempt to learn and create my own code editor.
